NARR (Not a rickroll) Is a project to keep rickrolls alive forever by making all types of rickrolls available in one place, this project is still in beta and may have potential issues

**Rickrolls used:**

[Original Rickroll](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=Psr8hN5m2UX0iX3T)

[4k Rickroll](https://youtu.be/o-YBDTqX_ZU?si=mbFGjB3kGCf0knof)

**Future plans:**

I plan to add more websites if the link becomes too recognizable

I plan to create applications which you can name and change the logo to anything for all platforms to rickroll people looking for cracked apps
